# OneConnect Python Wrapper

Clavister NetWall OIDC + OpenConnect helper with a reusable core and a systray GUI for Ubuntu/Linux.

## Installation

**From source using a virtual environment** (recommended on managed Linux, e.g. Debian/Ubuntu, where system Python is externally managed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matnordlund/oneconnect-python.git
cd oneconnect-python
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Then run the CLI or GUI with the venv active:

- `oneconnect` — CLI (list, add-profile, connect, disconnect, status)
- `oneconnect-gui` — systray icon and profile manager (GTK3, Yaru theme)

To leave the venv: `deactivate`. To use the app again later: `cd oneconnect-python && source .venv/bin/activate`, then `oneconnect` or `oneconnect-gui`.

**Fedora/RHEL (CLI):** `python3 -m venv` works out of the box (no separate
`python3-venv` package needed), and `pip install -e .` succeeds with pip's
default build isolation — the build-isolation workarounds below are a
Debian/Ubuntu-specific issue and shouldn't be needed here. Install the
system prerequisites first:

```bash
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip git openconnect polkit
git clone https://github.com/matnordlund/oneconnect-python.git
cd oneconnect-python
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

If SELinux is enforcing (the default on Fedora/RHEL), see
[docs/SELINUX.md](docs/SELINUX.md) — `openconnect` runs in a confined
domain and needs a policy module before `connect`/`disconnect` will work.

**From source without venv** (when your system allows it):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matnordlund/oneconnect-python.git
cd oneconnect-python
pip install -e .
```

**Run without installing** (from repo root):

```bash
python3 oneconnect_cli.py list
python3 -m oneconnect_gui.app   # GUI
```

### Install troubleshooting

- **ReadTimeoutError / "No matching distribution found" for setuptools**  
  By default, pip uses *build isolation*: it downloads setuptools and wheel from PyPI into a temporary environment and does not use your system (or venv) setuptools. If PyPI is slow or unreachable, use one of these:

  - **Use system setuptools (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu with `python3-setuptools` installed):** create the venv with access to system site-packages, then install without build isolation so the build uses the system setuptools and wheel:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
    ```
  - Increase timeout and retry: `pip install --timeout 120 -e .`
  - If the venv already has setuptools and wheel (e.g. you installed them earlier), run: `pip install --no-build-isolation -e .`

## Project layout

This project consists of:

- `oneconnect_core`: reusable auth, profile, AV, and OpenConnect launch logic
- `oneconnect_gui`: a GTK3 systray app and profile manager (Ubuntu/Yaru)
- `oneconnect_cli.py`: a simple CLI for testing and automation

## Highlights

- Uses the OpenConnect CLI client for the tunnel itself
- Uses system-browser OIDC with a loopback callback
- Normalizes hostnames like `vpn.example.com` to `https://vpn.example.com`
- Detects OpenConnect version from the installed binary
- Builds `ClientEnvironment` from the Linux host:
  - `ClientVersion`: `openconnect --version` without leading `v`
  - `OperatingSystemArchitecture`: `uname -m`
  - `OperatingSystemInformation`: `/etc/os-release` `PRETTY_NAME`, else `uname -o`
- Supports `pkexec` for privileged OpenConnect launch/disconnect
- When using pkexec (default), the direct backend runs OpenConnect with `--background`, writes a per-profile PID file under `~/.config/oneconnect/` (e.g. `openconnect-Demo.pid`); connection output is appended to `openconnect-<profile>.log` in the same directory; disconnect uses the PID file to terminate the correct process. By default OpenConnect drops from root to the invoking user (`--setuid`) right after connecting, so disconnect doesn't need pkexec (the daemon runs as your user). Pass `--no-setuid` to keep the daemon root for its whole lifetime instead — needed if `vpnc-script` fails to tear down routes/DNS on disconnect (`RTNETLINK: Operation not permitted`); in that mode disconnect also goes through pkexec, since the daemon is root.

## Profile storage

Profiles are stored in:

`~/.config/oneconnect/profiles.json`

Each profile supports:

- NetWall server URI
- optional server certificate pin
- OpenConnect user-agent and `--os`
- extra OpenConnect arguments
- AV mode and AV script path

## AV / posture handling

There is no universal Linux desktop AV API, so this app supports three modes:

- `auto`: heuristic checks for ClamAV-like state
- `script`: run a script and parse its result
- `manual`: fixed values stored per profile

### Script contract

Your AV script may output either:

```text
TRUE
```

or

```text
FALSE
```

or

```text
enabled=TRUE updated=TRUE
```

The script is expected to return exit code `0` on success.

## GUI features

The GUI is systray-first and uses the system theme (e.g. Yaru on Ubuntu, including dark/light):

- **System tray (Ayatana AppIndicator):** One icon in the panel; menu lists all configured profiles and shows connection status at the bottom. Select “Connect to” → &lt;profile&gt; to connect. When connected, the icon changes, and the menu shows “Connected: &lt;name&gt;”, “Disconnect”, and “View log”. Open “Manage profiles” from the menu to add, edit, delete, or connect from the profile manager window. To open the profile manager at startup, run `oneconnect-gui --manage-profiles`.
- After installing the `.deb`, the app appears in the start menu as “OneConnect”.
- **Tray icon on Ubuntu/GNOME:** Install the AppIndicator extension and enable AppIndicators so the tray icon appears: `sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-appindicator`. Then open **Extensions** (or GNOME Tweaks), find **AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support** (or **Ubuntu AppIndicators**), and turn it **on**. Without this, the tray icon will not show; you can still run `oneconnect-gui --manage-profiles` to use the profile manager window.
- **Dependencies:** GTK3 and an app indicator. The GUI tries Ayatana first, then the older AppIndicator3, so it works with either. On Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1` (or on older distros: `gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1`). Install the matching library if needed (e.g. `libayatana-appindicator3-1`). The GUI needs the `gi` module (PyGObject). In a normal venv, `gi` is usually not installed (it is provided by the system package `python3-gi`). Either: (1) install system packages and run the GUI with system Python: `sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1` then `python3 -m oneconnect_gui.app`; or (2) create the venv with `python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages` so the venv can use the system's `python3-gi`. The GUI will then prepend system typelib paths so the indicator is found. The GUI uses the direct OpenConnect backend only (no NetworkManager option in the tray). You may see a deprecation warning from libayatana-appindicator at startup; it is harmless.

**Start at login (Debian/Ubuntu):** Copy the included autostart desktop file into your user autostart directory so the tray starts when you log in:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
cp oneconnect-gui-autostart.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
```

If `oneconnect-gui` is not on your session PATH (typical when using a venv), edit the copied file and set `Exec` to the full path to the executable, for example:

```ini
Exec=/home/you/oneconnect-python/.venv/bin/oneconnect-gui
```

To open the profile manager at login as well, use:

```ini
Exec=/home/you/oneconnect-python/.venv/bin/oneconnect-gui --manage-profiles
```

Log out and back in (or reboot) to test. To disable, remove the file from `~/.config/autostart/` or set `X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false` inside it.

## CLI examples

Add a profile:

```bash
oneconnect add-profile --name Demo --server-uri sg.demo.clavister.com
# or from source: python3 oneconnect_cli.py add-profile --name Demo --server-uri sg.demo.clavister.com
```

Connect using `pkexec` by default:

```bash
oneconnect connect Demo
```

Connect without `pkexec`:

```bash
oneconnect connect Demo --no-pkexec
```

Status (direct backend: checks pid file and parses log for connection IP; omit profile to show all):

```bash
oneconnect status
oneconnect status Demo
```

Disconnect (omit profile to disconnect all connected profiles):

```bash
oneconnect disconnect
oneconnect disconnect Demo
```

## NetworkManager backend *(experimental, mostly broken)*

**Warning:** The NetworkManager integration is experimental and often fails in practice (e.g. “Connection activation failed: Unknown reason” with current NM-openconnect on many distros). Prefer the default direct OpenConnect backend for reliable use.

You can run the VPN via **NetworkManager** instead of launching OpenConnect directly. The same OIDC flow and cookie are used; only the tunnel is started by NM’s openconnect plugin.

**Enable:**

- **CLI:** pass `--nm` (or `--network-manager`) to `connect` / `disconnect`, or set the default via config/env.
- **Config:** create `~/.config/oneconnect/config.json` with `{"use_networkmanager": true}`.
- **Env:** set `ONECONNECT_USE_NM=1` (overrides config file).

**Requirements:** `nmcli` and the openconnect VPN plugin (e.g. `network-manager-openconnect` or `NetworkManager-openconnect` on your distro). The plugin must be installed so that `nmcli connection add type vpn` can create an openconnect connection.

**CLI with NM:**

```bash
oneconnect connect Demo --nm
oneconnect disconnect Demo --nm
```

**If you see "No valid secrets":** (1) On failure, the passwd-file path is logged—inspect it with `cat /tmp/tmpXXXX.txt`. (2) See which secrets the plugin expects by running `nmcli connection up oneconnect-<name> --ask` and noting the prompt labels (Cookie, Gateway, etc.). (3) For more detail, run with `NM_DEBUG=debug` and check `journalctl -u NetworkManager`.

Internally, when `--nm` is enabled, OneConnect now performs a short TLS probe after the OIDC/NetWall bootstrap to discover the final AnyConnect connect URL and the gateway certificate fingerprint. These values are fed into NetworkManager as:

- `vpn.secrets.cookie` – the `webvpn=...` cookie returned by NetWall.
- `vpn.secrets.gateway` – the final connect URL (after any redirects).
- `vpn.secrets.gwcert` – the TLS certificate fingerprint, which NM-openconnect passes to `openconnect` as `--servercert`.

If the probe cannot obtain a fingerprint (for example due to TLS or connectivity issues), the CLI automatically falls back to launching `openconnect` directly instead of NetworkManager, so `oneconnect connect Demo` continues to work even when `oneconnect connect Demo --nm` cannot be satisfied by the local NM/openconnect stack.

## Dependencies

Core runtime:

- Python 3.11+
- `aiohttp`
- `PyJWT`

GUI runtime (Ubuntu/Debian):

- GTK3 and an app indicator: `gir1.2-gtk-3.0` and either `gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1` (preferred) or `gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1` (older distros); matching lib if needed (e.g. `libayatana-appindicator3-1`)
- PyGObject (`python3-gi`)

OpenConnect runtime:

- `openconnect`
- `pkexec` recommended

**Fedora/RHEL:** SELinux's targeted policy confines `openconnect`
(`vpnc_exec_t`) by default, so a fresh enforcing install won't work out of
the box — see [docs/SELINUX.md](docs/SELINUX.md) to generate and load the
missing policy.

When using the NetworkManager backend:

- NetworkManager with `nmcli`
- openconnect VPN plugin (e.g. `network-manager-openconnect`)

## Notes

- This starter has been improved based on live Debian testing, but it is still a starter project rather than a packaged product.
- NetworkManager integration is implemented as an optional, experimental backend (CLI `--nm`, config/env); it is mostly broken on many setups—use direct OpenConnect for reliability.

## Debian package builds

This repository now includes native Debian packaging metadata under `debian/` that builds two packages:

- `oneconnect` (CLI)
- `oneconnect-gui` (tray/profile manager)

For full build, multi-arch, and distribution instructions, see:

- [docs/DEB-PACKAGING.md](docs/DEB-PACKAGING.md)

An example user-level autostart file is included and packaged as documentation:

- `oneconnect-gui-autostart.desktop`

When installing built `.deb` files manually, use `apt` (not `dpkg`) so
dependencies are resolved automatically:

```bash
sudo apt install ./oneconnect_0.1.0-1_all.deb ./oneconnect-gui_0.1.0-1_all.deb
```
